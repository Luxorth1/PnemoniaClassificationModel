    "### Module 4 Project | Image Classification Algorithm | X-Ray Imaging to Detect Pneumonia Case\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to create a machine learning algorithm that will successfully classify images into 2 categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive for Pneumonia\n",
    "* Negative for Pneumonia\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric of success for this will be a high (INSERT METRIC FOUND) score. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The methodology that will be used for this project will be the OSEMN Methodology. I will outline the methodology below.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain: Gather data from relevant sources\n",
    "* Scrub: Clean data to formats that machine understands\n",
    "* Explore: Find significant patterns and trends using statistical methods\n",
    "* Model: Construct models to predict and forecast\n",
    "* iNterpret: Put results into good use\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be our Obtain step in our OSEMN as we did not need to do much data mining for this data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data was obtained from [Here](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/3) which is a dataset of thousands of chest x-ray images from both patients who have pnemonia and who do not. This labeled data will allow us to create a classification machine in order to determine whether a patient has a case of pnemonia based of a chest x-ray."
